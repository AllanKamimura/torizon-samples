# debian-container

Toradex provides Debian based container images that derive from the slim release of Debian, with the meaning to bring for our costumers a light image with disabled manual pages and suggested packages installation, limiting dependencies only for the required ones.-

This repository offers a quick demonstration to run in our SoMs, also granting a look in how docker-compose works. Please refer to [Debian Container for Torizon](https://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/debian-container-for-torizon) to learn more.
